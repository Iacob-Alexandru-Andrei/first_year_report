  abstract  = {We consider training models with differential privacy (DP) using mini-batch gradients. The existing state-of-the-art, Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), requires \emph{privacy amplification by sampling or shuffling} to obtain the best privacy/accuracy/computation trade-offs. Unfortunately, the precise requirements on exact sampling and shuffling can be hard to obtain in important practical scenarios, particularly federated learning (FL). We design and analyze a DP variant of Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) that compares favorably (both theoretically and empirically) to amplified DP-SGD, while allowing for much more flexible data access patterns. DP-FTRL does not use any form of privacy amplification.}

  abstract   = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been a challenging problem yet it needs to be solved. It will mainly be used for eldercare and healthcare as an assistive technology when ensemble with other technologies like Internet of Things(IoT). HAR can be done with the help of sensors, smartphones or images. In this paper, we present various state-of-the-art methods and describe each of them by literature survey. Different datasets are used for each of the methods wherein the data are collected by different means such as sensors, images, accelerometer, gyroscopes, etc. and the placement of these devices at various locations. The results obtained by each technique and the type of dataset are then compared. Machine learning techniques like decision trees, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machines, hidden markov models are reviewed for HAR and later the survey for deep neural network techniques like artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks is also presented.},
